Add breakpoint:
	- addBreakpoint(address, MANUAL)
	
Remove breakpoint:
	- restore 4 bytes
	- remove breakpoint + 4 bytes from the breakpoint list
	
Step:
	- inject temp breakpoints
	- clear post-step breakpoint restore
	- if manual breakpoint on current line:
		- set post-step breakpoint restore to current line
		- removeBreakpoint(post-step breakpoint restore)
	- set stepping bit
	- return to code
	
Breakpoint handler:
	- remove temp breakpoints
	- if post-step breakpoint restore:
		- addBreakpoint(post-step breakpoint restore, MANUAL)
		- clear post-step breakpoint restore
	- open UI (possibly to different states according to stepping bit) and clear stepping bit
			
Inject temp breakpoints:
	- addBreakpoint(next line address, TEMP)
	- if it's an If, Else, While, Repeat, For, loop End, Goto, or Call: (jump address != 0 && jump address != -1)
		- addBreakpoint(jump address, TEMP)
	- else if it's a Return or ReturnIf (jump address == -1)
		- addBreakpoint(return address, TEMP)
